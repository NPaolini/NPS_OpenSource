RegisterService() checks the parameterlist.
The following parameters will be detected:
   -i      install the service (calls
         "InstallService()" - see below)

     -l <account>
         <account> is the name of a user,
         under which the service shall run.
         This option is useful with -i only.
         <account> needs to have the advanced
         user-right "Log on as a service"
         (see User-Manager)
         <account> should have the following
         format: "<Domain>\<user>"
         "EuroS2Team\jko" for instance.
         The domain "." is predefined as the
         local machine. So one might use
         ".\jko" too.

     -p <password>
         The password of the user, under which
         the service shall run. Only useful
         with -i and -l together.

   -u      uninstall the service (calls
         "RemoveService()" - see below)

   -d      debug the service (run as console
         process; calls "DebugService()"
         see below)

   -e      end the service (if it is running)

   -s      start the service (if it is not running)
         (Note that *you* normally cannot start
         an NT-service from the command-line.
         The SCM can.)
